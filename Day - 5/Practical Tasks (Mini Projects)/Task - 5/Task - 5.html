        <h2>About Minecraft</h2>
        <p>Minecraft is a popular 3D sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios where players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated world to gather resources, craft items, and build structures. It has no set goals and can be played in different ways, including the creative mode, which offers unlimited resources, and the survival mode, where players must gather resources, fight monsters, and stay alive. The game is known for its open-ended gameplay that encourages creativity, exploration, and problem-solving. </p>
