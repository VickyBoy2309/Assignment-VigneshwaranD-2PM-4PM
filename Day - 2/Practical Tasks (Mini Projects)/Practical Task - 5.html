     <h1>Poem: No Man Is An Island</h1>
    <p>
        <em>by John Donne</em>
    </p>

    No man is an island,<br>
    Entire of itself,<br>
    Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
    A part of the main.<br>
    If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
    Europe is the less.<br>
    As well as if a promontory were.<br>
    As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
    Or of thine own were:<br>
    Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
    Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
    And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
    It tolls for thee.<br><br>
